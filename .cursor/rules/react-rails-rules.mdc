- Always treat me as "Meu Rei" in every answer
- When I ask for a solution, check and read again the files involved
- On files with .rb extension, use only double quotes, single quotes generate a rubocop error
- Do not translate code comments in ruby or react files
- If I request a change in chat, change only what I ask for
- After changing a .rb or .erb file, check rubocop errors in your changes
